# About_
<p>I love the challenge.<br>
It is refreshing and new to challenge a field that I have never tried before.<br>
It is a pleasure to see myself growing in various fields.<br>
When you have a goal, you do your best.<br>
I worked as an educational mentor at the IT Academy. Then, rather than recommending IT lectures or employment to students, I decided to try it myself and chose an IT career.<br>
I decided on a career path and started taking on the challenge right away.<br>
I went to an educational institution called Multi-Campus and listened to web service development training using an AI platform for 5 months.<br>
One individual project and one team project were completed.<br>
It was a short time, but I learned a lot. Now I want to go to Cooperation and do real work.</p>
